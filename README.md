# Random Quote Generator

### By Omar Siddiqui

## Project Outline 

This aim of this project is to utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript together to create a app that generates quotes. A "next quote" button generates a new quote to the screen and the twitter icon links you to twitte where you can tweet a quote. 

This project fetches quotes from a quote api and I desplay these quotes on the webpage. 


## What I learned
* How to link JavaScript code to HTML and CSS
* How to make a webpage more responsive through JavaScript
* Utilizing a API to fetch data thats in a JSON format 
* Handling and using data that is in a JSON format 
* Implementing a GitHub repository to version control the project. Applying GitHub commands to: add, commit, push, pull, reset, backtrack code, etc.
